--------------------------------------------
A. Setting up SIMPL
--------------------------------------------

1. Extract the Package. Under Linux:

   cd $HOME
   tar -zxvf simpl.tar.gz

Note, it will create the directory $HOME/simpl

2. Create the directory where FIFOs live
   (Required by the SIMPL library)

   mkdir $HOME/fifo

3. Set up FIFO_PATH environment variable by adding these to your .cshrc

   setenv SIMPL_HOME $HOME/simpl
   setenv FIFO_PATH $HOME/fifo 

TIPS: The SIMPL library make use of the FIFO_PATH to store 
temporary files during the messaging. When you encounter strange problem 
while running the programs, just quite your program (i.e. press Ctrl-C).
Check if you got some useless processes by:

  ps -u <username>

KILL all the useless processes by:

  killall <process name>

and clean up the directory pointed by FIFO_PATH by:

  rm -f $FIFO_PATH/*



--------------------------------------------
B. Executing the sample programs
--------------------------------------------

1. Sample program of Part A

   You can run the sample by:

    ./animate   

2. Sample program of Part B

   You can run the game under Linux with default parameters by:

    ./run -d

  Note, you can type ./run without any arguments to see the list of options.
  If you encounter some problem while running the game and pressed Ctrl-C, 
  you can use the following scripts clean up those useless processes:

    ./flush

  Enjoy the game!
